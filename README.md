# Interactive statistic files
Interactive statistic files to supplement the data for a paper (in progress) regarding the effects of intervention strategies (Exercise, low-fat diet, and a combination of both) on the triple transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's Disease (3xTgAD) and their wild-type counterpart fed with a high-fat diet.

### Figure 4B. T-statistic maps of the effects on the brain volume among groups compared against the control (LFD-NI-WT)
Note:  T-statistic maps subjected to a 5% FDR threshold are graphically represented to elucidate the spatial distribution of significance across the brain. In plot B, only significant negative t-values are displayed as they encompass the predominant share of significant effects demonstrated in Figure A; notably, there was an almost complete absence of significant positive t-values.
